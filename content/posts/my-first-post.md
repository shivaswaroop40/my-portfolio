I'm excited to share my journey as a **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** and **MSc Communication Systems** student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

From Bengaluru to Stockholm, my path has been driven by a passion for technology and innovation. After completing my Bachelor's in Telecommunication Engineering, I spent over 3 years working with cloud technologies, helping organizations build better, more efficient infrastructure.

Now, I'm pursuing my Master's degree at KTH, diving deeper into advanced networking, security, and cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of communication systems.
